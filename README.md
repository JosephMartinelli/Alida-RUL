# Machine Learning approaches for RUL calculation using ALIDA</a>

This project's objective is to create a series of ALIDA's services aimed to estimation
of remaining useful life (RUL) given a run to failure dataset.
<a href="http://home.alidalab.it/">ALIDA</a> 
is a Data Science & Machine Learning Platform designed to simplify 
the management, execution, and monitoring of data science and machine 
learning projects.

In the ALIDA ecosystem, services are independent, 
containerized microapplications designed to handle specific inputs and 
generate outputs. ALIDA manages their full lifecycle and communication, 
which typically leverages the platform’s object storage (MinIO). 
From a developer’s perspective, the main requirement is to adhere to 
the service definition outlined in the documentation, allowing ALIDA to 
seamlessly coordinate communication between services.
